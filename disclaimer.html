In each episode, we explore this world through parts of the government of this future world, the role it plays and the intentions behind the choices they make. At the end of each episode ( and before the next one ) we create an article with artifacts from the chosen ministry and a write up about the world.

— a future where it’s cheaper to hire humans than robots cos hey there’s too many people in this world. The world has been forced into a universal currency, called govcoins. Everything you do, like hitting your 10k steps per day, or paying your taxes on time could earn you coins which you can use to purchase freedoms, goods, services, rights and so on.
